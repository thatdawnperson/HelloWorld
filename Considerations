What is your ideal job or career?
If it’s not what you’re doing now, what do you need to change to reach your goals?
How much of that work is underway or planned?
Is it possible in this day and age for most people to be satisfied with their job or situation?

It’s okay if your ideal changes.
When I was five year old, I wanted to be an astronaut.
At fifteen, I wanted to be an author or editor.
At twenty-five, I wanted to write software.
At thirty-five, I wanted to use my technical skills to improve the lives of both my fellow technologists and the people whose lives our work affected.
At forty-five, I wanted to use leadership skills to align technology solutions with organizational needs and shepherd the professional and personal development of technology workers. 
Over the course of earning an MBA, I realized that I don’t have to work directly with technology and technologists: all else being equal, I’d prefer to use these strengths but I’m also open to possibilities outside computers, networks, and software development.

At the core of the evolution of my ideals is a desire to do meaningful work that helps people and communities.
If you don’t think astronauts help people, take a look at role models from John Glenn to Julie Payette.
I believe most people want their work to be of some value of “the world” or “my community” in a way that has meaning to them.
I’ve had conversations with people in jobs from food services and mail delivery to leadership in large organizations and entrepreneurs: people come in to their jobs or learning or volunteering regularly because they matter. The ones who don’t, and there are many in this category we well, want a change in their situation.
